# College-Projects
Major projects completed while at college.

Note:

1. Every Python file was done in Python 2.7 except for the Search Engine Project.

2. The Search Engine Project had to many files to upload so I put in the major coded Python files.

3. Comments might be severly lacking in most of these projects due to class leniency/early projects this will not be a problem in the future. 

4. I could not upload my image processing projects that were done in Ubuntu Qt OpenCV as the uploader says my files are empty when they are not.
